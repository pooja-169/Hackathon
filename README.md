# AI-Driven Media Investment Plan Across Channels for E-commerce

## Introduction:

Welcome to our Hackathon! This event challenges you to develop an AI-driven media investment plan for e-commerce businesses. Your task is to re-allocate the budget across various paid media channels to optimize customer acquisition and conversion rates. By analyzing the performance of each channel throughout different phases of the customer journey, you will use machine learning to identify trends and patterns. Based on this analysis, you will allocate the budget to various paid media channels to maximize conversion.

## Why This Solution Needs to Be Built:

In the ever-evolving landscape of digital marketing, e-commerce businesses must continually optimize their media investments to stay competitive. Understanding how different ad channels perform at various stages of the customer journey is crucial for effective budget allocation. An
AI-driven solution can provide deeper insights into customer behavior, allowing businesses to make data-driven decisions that enhance customer acquisition and increase conversion rates. This, in turn, will lead to improved ROI on marketing spend and higher revenue.
